## Component design test

The test consists of layout a component as accurately as possible.

### Requirements:
- The component has a hover that makes the box bigger.
- Buttons have hover.
- These hover expects them to be animated with transitions.
- Mandatory use of flexbox.
- The component has a central part with "phases", there are 3 types, it's a plus to do all 3, otherwise you can do all the phases, do the phases of the central component.
- The progress bar is animated, i.e. when it loads it has to go from 0 to the set percentage.


To run the project:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```
